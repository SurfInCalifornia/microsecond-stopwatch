This is a Windows-only stopwatch. As noted in the name of this repository, the smallest unit on the stopwatch is 1 microsecond. The largest unit is hours, however after 24 hours the stopwatch will keep counting. For example, exactly one day and one hour after the stopwatch starts the stopwatch will read 25:00:00.000000.
